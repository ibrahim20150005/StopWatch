# StopWatch
Design a class called Stopwatch. The job of this class is to simulate a stopwatch. It should provide two methods: Start and Stop. We call the start method first, and the stop method next. Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration between start and stop. Duration should be a value in TimeSpan. Display the duration on the console. We should also be able to use a stopwatch multiple times. So we may start and stop it and then start and stop it again
